# ePaper meetingroom display server

This repository contains the source code of the server that connects to the NOI meeting rooms calendar, takes the meeting information (e.g. meeting name, organizer name, start time, end time, etc.) and send it to the ePaper display installed in the meetingrooms. The server manages also the booking funtionality that allows the user to book the room, if available, by using the ePaper touch display installed in the meeting room.
